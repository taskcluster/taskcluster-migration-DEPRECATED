# The overall plan for Windows is this:
#
# Tests are easy and basically already done.  The tricky bit is Talos, since it
# is tied to hardware.
#
# * Using try or date, green up talos for (existing) opt and debug TC builds via BBB
# * Switch the TC builds and BB-via-BBB tests to tier 1; this starts the
#   6-12 week beta clock
# * Deploy a taskcluster worker to a small portion of linux buildslaves
# * Using try or date, green up talos using those taskcluster workers
# * Deploy to the remainder of the buildslaves, converting suite by suite
#   to manage teh load across teh split pool of hardware, until 100% TC
#
# This moves all Windows build platforms together, all Windows test platforms together,
# That is, we will not get Win10 to the finish line and then go back to start over with
# Win7.
#
# Windows XP is not an issue; since these changes ride the trains, and will get on
# the trains after XP is gone, it will never cross paths with TaskCluster.
#
# The testing platforms are windows 7 (32-bit) and windows 10 (64-bit).  Note
# that this process assumes the current win8 -> win10 transition is
# sufficiently complete in Buildbot that we need not concern ourselves with
# running win8 in TC.

        The artifacts in question are in the blobber-uploads directory.  It is
        impractical to configure these to go to a different location on TC
        only, so the better fix is to configure generic-worker to be able to
        upload artifacts it finds in teh blobber-uploads directory (this was
        the long-term solution anyway).
