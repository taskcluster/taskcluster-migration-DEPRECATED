# The overall plan for Windows is this:
#
# Tests are easy and basically already done.  The tricky bit is Talos, since it
# is tied to hardware.
#
# * Using try or date, green up talos for (existing) opt and debug TC builds via BBB
# * Switch the TC builds and BB-via-BBB tests to tier 1; this starts the
#   6-12 week beta clock
# * Deploy a taskcluster worker to a small portion of linux buildslaves
# * Using try or date, green up talos using those taskcluster workers
# * Deploy to the remainder of the buildslaves, converting suite by suite
#   to manage teh load across teh split pool of hardware, until 100% TC
#
# This moves all Windows build platforms together, all Windows test platforms together,
# That is, we will not get Win10 to the finish line and then go back to start over with
# Win7.
#
# Windows XP is not an issue; since these changes ride the trains, and will get on
# the trains after XP is gone, it will never cross paths with TaskCluster.
#
# The testing platforms are windows 7 (32-bit) and windows 10 (64-bit).  Note
# that this process assumes the current win8 -> win10 transition is
# sufficiently complete in Buildbot that we need not concern ourselves with
# running win8 in TC.

        The artifacts in question are in the blobber-uploads directory.  It is
        impractical to configure these to go to a different location on TC
        only, so the better fix is to configure generic-worker to be able to
        upload artifacts it finds in teh blobber-uploads directory (this was
        the long-term solution anyway).

        The test assumes the process is running in the active desktop, and
        thereby assumes that changes the display resolution will alter the
        desktop size.  Previously this was the case, as the active desktop was
        the desktop used by taskcluster tasks / buildbot jobs.  However, now we
        have sandboxed taskcluster tasks so that they do not share a desktop,
        but rather have their own desktop which cannot be exploited to gain
        access to an administrative account (since the previous desktop was
        running under an administrator account).

        Desktops are not properly garbage-collected, leading to workers
        eventually failing after running a few tasks.  This does not block
        greening tests, as the workers will just report "blue" jobs and fail,
        but needs to be fixed for tier 2.
