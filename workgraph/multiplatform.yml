        Each of these three worker implementations needs to be updated to use

taskcluster-worker-setup-cleanup:

    description: |
        For Buildbot jobs, runner takes care of some pre-task setup (warming
        caches, for example, to reduce end-to-end time) and post-task cleanup
        (clearing temporary directories, killing stray processes, etc.).  We
        will need similar functionality with taskcluster-worker, either by
        using runner or implementing it with some other mechanism
