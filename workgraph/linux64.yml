# The overall plan for Linux64 is this:
#
# Tests are easy and basically already done.  The tricky bit is Talos, since it
# is tied to hardware.
#
# * Using try or date, green up talos for (existing) opt and debug TC builds via BBB
# * Switch the TC builds and BB-via-BBB tests to tier 1; this starts the
#   6-12 week beta clock
# * Deploy a taskcluster worker to a small portion of linux test bb workers
# * Using try or date, green up talos using those taskcluster workers
# * Deploy to the remainder of the test bb workers, converting suite by suite
#   to manage the load across the split pool of hardware, until 100% TC
