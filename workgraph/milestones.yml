linux-android-tier1-cleanup:
    title: "Post Linux/Android tier 1 cleanup"
    description: |
        All the bits that don't block tier 1, but should be wrapped up immediately thereafter.
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-02-01

win7-testing-tier2:
    title: "Windows 7 non-hardware tests running in TC against TC builds at tier 2"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-01-20
    description: |
        Run test for Windows 7 builds in TaskCluster EC2 instances at tier 2,
        debugging host- and taskcluster-related issues along the way.
    dependencies:
        - windows-tests-win7-tier2

linux-android-nightlies-tier2:
    title: "Linux32/64 and android nightlies at tier2"
    milestone: true
    due: 2016-12-02
    done: true
    description: |
        Nightlies for the linux32, linux64, and Android platforms are
        implemented on a project branch, and can be dogfooded by team members.
        Balrog updates are included, along with all of the other particulars.
    dependencies:
        - linux32-nightlies-tier2
        - linux64-nightlies-tier2

taskcluster-worker-on-mac:
    title: "taskcluster-worker works reliably on a small pool of Macs"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-01-03
    done: true
    description: |
        While we are not yet ready to shift production load to
        taskcluster-worker on hardware (the transition requires use of BBB and
        shifting all mac builds and tests to tier 1), we are confident that the
        tests will function correctly at that point.

linux-android-tier1:
    title: "Linux32/64 and android at tier1"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-01-17
    description: |
        All builds and tests for the linux32, linux64, and Android platforms
        are running in TaskCluster at tier 1, with Buildbot jobs demoted or
        disabled. All tasks are scheduled via TaskCluster, but hardware-only
        tasks are executed via BBB.  Since tier-1 opt builds are what we ship
        to users, this also requires nightlies and preparations for making full
        releases when they are due.
    dependencies:
        - linux32-opt-tier1
        - linux64-opt-tier1

linux64-talos-on-hardware:
    title: "Linux64 Talos is running via TC worker on hardware"
    description: |
        Linux64 talos jobs are green in TaskCluster, and (almost) all hardware
        Buildslaves have been reimaged to run taskcluster-worker directly.
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-02-15
    dependencies:

macosx-native-on-hardware:
    title: "MacOS X Talos is running via TC worker on hardware"
    description: |
        MacOS X Tests and Talos are green in TaskCluster and (almots) all
        buildslaves have been reimaged to run taskcluster-worker directly.
        This needs to happen before the hardware begins moving in 2017Q3, as
        that move will take most of a year.
    milestone: true

no-buildbot-schedulers:
    title: "Buildbot schedulers are disabled (except ESR)"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-12-31
    description: |
        The Buildbot scheduler masters are no longer scheduling any jobs except
        ESR builds.

all-releases:
    title: "Everything has been released at least once from TC (except ESR)"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-12-31

        We have performed a final release for all platforms, built and tested
        on all TaskCluster.

    title: "Turn off Buildbot except for ESR and Thunderbird"
    milestone: true
    due: 2017-12-31
    description: |
        Buildbot is almost completely unused -- with the exception of ESR and
        Thunderbird, which we just have to wait for.  The Buildbot
        infrastructure is drastically scaled back and left to run until it is
        no longer used.
