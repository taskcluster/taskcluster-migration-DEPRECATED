# The overall plan for OS X is this:
#
#  * Get all builds, including opt, running in TC at tier 2
#  * Using try or date, green up tests/talos on those builds via BBB
#  * Switch the TC builds and BB-via-BBB tests to tier 1; this starts the
#    6-12 week beta clock
#  * Deploy a taskcluster worker to a small portion of the buildslaves
#  * Using try or date, green up tests using those taskcluster workers
#  * Deploy to the remainder of the buildslaves, converting suite by suite
#    to manage the load across the split pool of hardware, until 100% TC
#
# Tests and Talos travel together here.  Although they may present different
# problems, from the deployment perspective they are the same and share the
# same hardware pool.
